Zach gave us a tools lecture today - he basically showed us all of these amazing tools (programming languages) to try out and experiment with. Some were so simplistic, yet they could do so much! He showed us [Context Free](http://www.contextfreeart.org/), [NodeBox](http://nodebox.net/), [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/), and [Chuck](http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/). Context Free and NodeBox were viz tools and SuperCollider and Chuck were sound tools. Zach gave us homework to find a tool that noone else is using and experiment with it for the next week. 

I played around with [The Dasher Project](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/). It's a way to type without the keyboard and super fun to use. I don't know that I could make something with it but it was a cool find. I also spent some time exploring [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) and I ended up drawing a cat with it!

You can find the code on [github](https://github.com/paigederaedt/paperjs/blob/master/draw_cat.html).  

We spent the rest of the day experimenting with the tools and working on our presentations. All of us did a rehearsal of the presentations and then got ready for the welcome party. There were about 100 people who showed up with some pretty amazing people in the audience (Jer Thorpe). I was super nervous to present in front of that many people, but it was also sort of exhilarating at the same time! So glad I did it but so glad it's over. I also received a lot of really supportive encouragement from other students which was really nice. It was such a great week!
