This morning, Zach checked in with us about prepping for our final open house mentor session and party. After that, we had some time to continue preparing for the event by polishing up sketches and researching our mentors. 

After lunch we had Ramsey's last class. A bunch of students were able to show off some languages they had created which were super innovative. Check out Yuki's [Comic Strip](http://yukiy.github.io/ComicStripScript/) language: changing the code changes the facial expressions in the comics...super cute!

Later on, we just spent the rest of the day and night continuing to prep for the final mentor session/party. I'm really anxious to meet with Marius and Kyle because they're so awesome, but super excited of course. The party seems like it's going to be a lot of fun - I know that Ida, Taeyoon, and all the other teachers have put a lot of work into making it a really memorable night.
