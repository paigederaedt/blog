Today was Taeyoon's first hardware class! We started with learning logic gates and their associated truth tables, and then we moved on the building their equivalent circuits (simple switch, buffer, not gate, and gate, or gate, nand gate, nor gate). This was pretty overwhelming as I have never touched circuits or hardware before, but after taking some time to digest and review logic gates with Rachel and Zan things started to make a little more sense. I got as far as creating the buffer with some help from Jonas and Zach.

Later that night, [Aram Bartholl](http://datenform.de/) spoke as our visiting artist. I really enjoyed his playful and humorous work and appreciated his theme of bringing the digital world back into the physical world. I think my favorite was his google street view car project.
