Today was our second studio day. We started with a stand up style check in on the second floor porch. We all brought or talked about a book we wanted to share with the class. I talked about 'House of Leaves' by Mark Danielewski because of it's really interesting text layouts on each page. Everyone else shared some awesome books as well! 

After this we listed to Zan demo a talk she is doing in November about Simpson's paradox. She demoed a new chart style she created with [Martin Wattenberg](http://www.bewitched.com/) to better visualize data so that this effect becomes more apparent. The paper that the talk about can be found [here](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/42901.pdf) 

The rest of the day was pretty standard studio...just continued to work on creating my circos visualization in d3.
