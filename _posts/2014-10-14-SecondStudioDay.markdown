Today was our second studio day. We started with a stand up style check in on the second floor porch. We all brought or talked about a book we wanted to share with the class. I talked about ['House of Leaves'](https://www.google.com/search?q=house+of+leaves&es_sm=119&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=ddxHVJGDNajlsATuoIKwDw&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1186&bih=720) by Mark Danielewski because of it's really interesting text layouts on each page. Everyone else shared some awesome books as well!

After this we listed to Zan demo a talk she is doing in November about Simpson's paradox. She demoed a new chart style she created with [Martin Wattenberg](http://www.bewitched.com/) to better visualize data so that this effect becomes more apparent. The paper that the talk about can be found [here](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/42901.pdf) 

The rest of the day was pretty standard studio...just continued to work on creating my circos visualization in d3. 

Here's a semi-finished product!:

I managed to get it animated. In the background, I have the list of words that contain each letter connected to each chord segment, but I need to figure out how to display them as well when you hover over.
