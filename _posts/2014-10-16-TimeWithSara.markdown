We started off Friday with some more discussion on assistive technology as well as more general feelings/concerns about the creative process at SFPC with Sara. All I can say is that she is remarkable. Each student had the chance to spend some 1:1 time with her as well. I was initially really nervous about this as I am with most interactions with amazing people, but she was so incredibly sincere. I felt pretty comfortable from the moment she started asking me questions. I focused my time with her on discussing 2 main tracks for project ideas that I have: crocheting + code and language + code. I started with my crocheting + code idea, and explained to her my concern of it falling flat with it being hard to create anything more substantial than an image crocheted in the shape of a rectangle.
