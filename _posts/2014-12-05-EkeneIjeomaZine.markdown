Today began with check in and artist talk with [Ekene Ijeoma](http://ekeneijeoma.com/). He's done a large amount of amazing work with techniques I'd really like to try including really cool manipulation of 3D forms. He even created his own javascript library called [ijeoma.js](https://github.com/ekeneijeoma/ijeoma.js) which I really want to try out!

After lunch, we had Allison's last CTOT class where we had a peer proof reading/edit/design session to create our zine. The finished product looks incredible thanks to Meghana's design skills and can be found [here](https://github.com/allisonburtch/Critical-Theory-of-Technology/blob/master/zine.pdf).

Later that night, a bunch of us checked out [Big Screens](http://itp.nyu.edu/bigscreens/), a show put on by ITP on some...big screens! I thought most works shown were pretty cool, but some of them were a little underwhelming or confusing. There was good cheese, other snacks, and drinks supplied, so we had fun!
