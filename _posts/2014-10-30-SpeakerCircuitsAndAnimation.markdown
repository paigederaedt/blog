We had a little more time this morning to work on our animations that were assigned by Zach. I'm really enjoying playing with open frameworks. I ended up making these blob like creatures that remind me a lot of butterflies.

I also finished up my John Whitney inspired animation as well:

Next was Taeyoon's class where we learned how to use a speaker to emit a square wave that we somehow created through a circuit...still wrapping my head around what happened, but it was pretty fun! We also got a chance to see the waves we had created in an oscilloscope.
