This afternoon started with another hardware class from Taeyoon. His idea for us was to think about illustrating some hardware concept through a simple object/process/contraption. Naturally my brain goes to cats...In a previous class, I had tried to illustrate the concept of memory with cats. [It sort of worked out](http://paigederaedt.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2014/11/06/DrawingMemory.html), but it inspired what I made for this class as well. Overall, the technical concept isn't revolutionary - just completing a circuit to light up an LED but I've had the most fun making this project as well as working with a similar idea for the Poetic Science Fair at Silent Barn. I think I just really miss sewing and making physical things with my hands.

Later on, Jason Levine led an intro to Shaders class which so much fun. Shaders feel so much more accessible to me on a technical level now (my mind is still churning through them conceptually). Here's a few examples of what I made in class:
